# Binomial Coefficient Calculator

## Description
This project calculates the binomial coefficient, commonly referred to as "n choose k". The binomial coefficient is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, representing the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements. This implementation provides both recursive and iterative methods to compute the coefficient.

## Usage
- Provide the values for \(n\) and \(k\), and the calculator will compute \(C(n, k)\).
  
## Features
- Recursive and iterative methods
- Efficient handling of large numbers
